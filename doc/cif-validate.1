.SH NAME
cif\-validate \- Validate the content of a mmCIF file
.SH SYNOPSIS
cif\-validate [OPTION] file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The mmCIF format is not really new, but the implementation of this format has been
taken up slowly. Unfornately, the knowledge of the ins and outs of the format are
still poorly understood and many files written contain errors.
.sp
\fIcif\-validate\fR can be used to help debug the creation of mmCIF files. By default
it uses the dictionary provided by \fIlibcifpp\fR (which may be updated automatically,
depending on your installion). But you can also specify your own dictionary file using
the \fB--dict\fR option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--dict\fR=<file>
The mmCIF dictionary file to use. The default is \fImmcif_pdbx.dic\fR.
.TP
\fB--validate-links\fR
Validate all links. Will output information about missing parent category items.
.TP
\fB--verbose\fR,\fB-v\fR
Be more verbose, useful to diagnose validation errors.
